## Sample Code

The following are links to the [Jupyter notebooks](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nuPIMlPOBy-XFg0jXTTVLvg4p7mFM-fF?usp=sharing) that we used in class.

## Textbook and Lecture Materials
I will use research papers describing both the background material as well as the 
current state of the art. 
Students are expected to understand the material as well as being able to implement 
simple versions of the described algorithm. 

A useful reference book is ["Reinforcement Learning"](https://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209/Readings/SuttonBartoIPRLBook2ndEd.pdf) 2nd Ed. by Sutton and Bartow, which is available online 

## Academic Dishonesty

Students are reminded that there are penalties for academic dishonesty. 
Academic dishonesty includes submitting assignments that are not entirely the studentâ€™s own work. 
A declaration sheet, which states that the work being submitted is completely your own, is  available here
[honesty declaration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VBXr9XeQqVWjMotxhb0qhim5mFffQ85YU86El-wlkZ0/edit?usp=sharing). 
This sheet must be filled out and attached to all assignments or projects, 
which you are submitting as part of your class work. 
No assignment or project will be marked unless the declaration is attached.

## Registration Advisory

If you are not entitled to be in this course, you will be withdrawn, or the course may not be used in your degree program. There will be no fee adjustment. This is not appealable.
