<h1>Deadline: 19th June 2023 - 23:59</h1>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate your ability to implement
and control dynamic motions of your leg assembly or humanoid robot.</p>
<p>You will implement a hybrid simulation - online reinforcement learner
that uses an artificial neural network or similar function approximator
to deal with the continuous state space of this problem.</p>
<p>You will demonstrate the control using: (a) a 1D marble game, (b) a 2D marble game, and (c) a triple jump.</p>
<h3>Camera Feedback</h3>
<p>Mount the camera of the Raspberry Pi so that you can track the position
of the ball with your controller.</p>
<p>Implement a program for the camera. I suggest a simple blob/color detector
to estimate the position of the ball.</p>
<h2>Challenge 1: 1D Marble Game</h2>
<p>First, replace the 2D marble game with a 1D marble game.
That is, construct a rail where the marble can move
forward and backwards only.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;width:40%"><table><tbody><tr><td><p><img src="./maze2.svg" alt="maze2"/></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1D Marble Game</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>The goal is to train the system to learn how to stop the marble in the
center of the track.</p>
<p>Note that the problem requires you to model both the position
and the speed of the marble.</p>
<p>Apply reinforcement learning to learn the control policy.
You can use a policy gradient based approach.
To speed up your learner, you can implement a simple simulation to bootsstrap
your learner.
Finally, the learning can continue online to match the specific hardware.</p>
<h2>Challenge 2: 2D Marble Game</h2>
<p>Extend the 1D marble game to 2D. The goal is for the ball to
come to a stop in the center of the maze.</p>
<div style="text-align:center;width:40%"><table><tbody><tr><td><p><img src="./maze3.svg" alt="maze3"/></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2D Marble Game</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>Apply reinforcement learning to learn the control policy.
You can use a policy gradient based approach.
To speed up your learner, you can implement a simple simulation to bootsstrap
your learner.
Finally, the learning can continue online to match the specific hardware.</p>
<h2>Challenge 3: Triple Jump</h2>
<p>In this challenge, we want to implement a triple jump event for
the leg design. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1138PG7zFm9Jh7_-GzMh-iRlojvYKK-k53MfjWW7KUEw/edit">Triple jump</a>
is an event in the <a href="https://firaworldcup.org/leagues/fira-sports/hurocup/">FIRA HuroCup</a> competition.</p>
<p>We use a simplifed version of the event in this assignment. The winner of the
competition is the team that can jump the furthest with a maximum of three jumps.</p>
<p>Apply reinforcement learning to learn the control policy.
You can use a policy gradient based approach.
To speed up your learner, you can implement a simple simulation to bootsstrap
your learner.
Finally, the learning can continue online to match the specific hardware.</p>
<h2>Honesty declaration</h2>
<p>By submitting an assignment, you claim that your submission is only your own work.
This means that you have developed the design, implemented the code, run the experiments,
and all other work necessary to complete the assignment by yourself.</p>
<p>If you discussed your work with other students or used sources on the Internet, then you <strong>must</strong>
say so clearly at the beginning of the assignment.</p>
<p>You can discuss parts of the assignment with others, but these discussions must be limited
to sharing ideas on a whiteboard or notepad. If you exchange code/programs/designs or
exchange any material via the Internet, then you must say so in your honesty declaration.</p>
<p>Fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z9FyOFt--OL_cqse55b-CifBgPDfFZi2L6-sUQBvZ4I/edit?usp=sharing">Honesty Declaration</a>
and add any external sources that you used during the assignment.</p>
<h2>Submissions</h2>
<p>This assignment must be done in groups of maximum two students.</p>
<p>If you use information or code that is not your own (e.g., sample code from the Internet,
ideas for new features from a classmate, etc.), then you must specify this in your assignment
write-up. Failure to disclose that you used external sources will lead to disciplinary actions.</p>
<p>To hand in your assignment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a directory to hold all of your data. The directory name should be &lt;student id&gt;_a&lt;number&gt;,
where &lt;student id&gt; is your student id and &lt;number&gt; is the number of the assignment,</li>
<li>Create a directory source inside of the directory &lt;student id&gt;_a&lt;number&gt;.</li>
<li>Put the source code, which may contain of multiple files, for your assignmentâ€™s solution
into the directory source.</li>
<li>Your prg\ram must compile by just running the command make in the source directory or a
similar step for your programming language of choice.</li>
<li>Write a README file to explain anything you feel is necessary or important about your
submission. This may include special features/bugs of your program. Describe what parts
of the assignment you implemented. It is in your interest to simplify the job of the marker.</li>
